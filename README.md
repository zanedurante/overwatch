# overwatch
A codebase for analyzing Overwatch

## Top 500 analyzer

The complete code for this is in `top_500_analyzer.py`, it currently only supports DPS character detection.  I added the mp4 from the NA ladder.  The EU/Asia ones were too large to put on GitHub but conceptually they are identical.  

## Coming soon!
Tanks/supports stats are coming soon!

## Hero pool maker

You can run `hero_pool.py` to run 

# Installation instructions 
All libraries used are installable via `pip`.  From the command line, you should be able to `pip install` each of them.
If you'd rather, you can do `pip install -r requirements.txt`, but you may run into issues here (I haven't tested installation from scratch).
Also, different versions of the required libraries should probably work as well, I was just lazy and dumped my working pip environment specs here.
